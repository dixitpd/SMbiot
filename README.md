# SMbiot
Scripts for SMbiot: Shared latent model for microbiomes and their hosts.

There are four directories in this directory. Any questions related to the analysis on "Chicken" and "Cows" should be addressed to Purushottam Dixit (pdixit@ufl.edu). Questions related to analysis on "Chicken antibiotics" and "Humans" should be addressed to German Plata (german@biomedit.com).

The provided scripts will take the data (data is also provided) and infer models when the dimension of the latent space is specified by the user. Other scripts will generate the figures and the tables in the paper.
